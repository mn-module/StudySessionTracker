    "### What is StudySession?\n",
    "\n",
    "The StudySession class is a part of my first open-source project, developed with the aim of providing a simple yet powerful tool for tracking study or work sessions. It's perfect for those who want to keep a disciplined track of their study hours and manage their time efficiently. It comes with a bunch of cool features like start, stop, pause, resume, discard, and reset. Pretty neat, right?"

    "### In this documentation, we'll be using two terms that are similar but refer to different concepts:\n",

    "*I'm using this terminology because I prefer not to repeat the word 'instance' too often. Referring to it as a 'study-session' instead of 'instance' is clearer and more concise, don’t you think? You might wonder why I use 'study-session' instead of 'study session.' The reason is that 'study session' has a different meaning, referring to the actual period of study being tracked.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*For example: if you start studying at 9:00 AM and stop at 10:00 AM, you've studied for 1 hour, and that period is what we call a 'study session'. But when you use this class and create an instance, that instance is what I refer to as a 'study-session'. Essentially, what you're doing is tracking your study session with a 'study-session'. I hope you've got it. Haha!*"

The class raises exceptions to prevent accidental overwriting of past session data.
